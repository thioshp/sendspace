 Welcome to the beta release of SendSpace Wizard for Linux.
=============================================================================


- Platforms ------------------------------------------------------------------
Supported platforms: Debian, both 32 and 64 bit.  

Although it should, it may not run on other distributions due to extensive
library dependencies.

- Running --------------------------------------------------------------------

1.  Select the appropriate binaries from the 32bit or 64bit directories
depending on your architecture.  You will most likely need to install the
latest version of the wxWidgets library, we currently link against 2.8.9.

2. Copy both binaries to your directory of choice and execute the 'sswizard'
binary.

- Dependencies ---------------------------------------------------------------

The Wizard depends on at least the following libraries:

libpthread, libgtk2, libgdk2, libfontconfig, libXext, libXrender, libXinerama,
libXi, libXrandr, libXcursor, libXfixes, libpango1, libobject2, libgmodule2,
libgthread2, librt1, libglib2, libSM, libjpeg, libz1, libcurl4,
libstdc++, libpangocairo1, libcairo2, libfreetype, libexpat1, libXam,
libXdmcp, libICE, libidn, libpangoft, libatk1, libgdk_pixbuff2, libpng,
libxml2.

A few more dependencies exist but they should exist in most desktop systems.

- Problems -------------------------------------------------------------------

Should you run the Wizard and it fails to execute, run the following command:

ldd ssgui_app | grep -i found

The output would show you the missing libraries you need to install before
attempting to run it again.

If you need help, send us the output of the above command as well as details
about your distribution.

- Enjoy ----------------------------------------------------------------------
